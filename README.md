<h2>Identifying an Azure Subscription</h2>
In this exercise, we will explore Azure subscriptions and the costing structures. An active subscription to the platform is needed to access, create, and manage cloud resources on the Azure portal.

<h2>Overview</h2>

- <b>An Azure subscription is used to create and access resources in the Azure portal. A company needs to create an Azure subscription to be able to utilize the cloud platform. Different permissions can be allocated to the subscription to ensure the correct accounts can be access the correct resources.</b> 
- <b>An Azure administrator with proper privileges (such as the global administrator) can discover information about a particular subscription by navigating to the Subscriptions pane on the Azure portal. From here, you can select an active subscription and view different overviews on each. This will also give you a birds-eye view of the current costs incurred for resources in Azure for that specific Subscription.

- <b>From here, an administrator can also view all accounts that have been associated to the subscription by visiting the Access Control (IAM) pane on the navigation blade. Specific roles can be allocated to these accounts, depending on what the account will be used for.
In each userâ€™s profile, activity is logged. This can be used for security purposes and verify when users have logged in and which activities these users have performed

  <h2>Cost Management in Azure </h2>

- <b>The cost of cloud resources is a critical component that needs to be monitored very closely. Unlike on-premise resources purchased and are a once-off cost, cloud resources are paid as per use scenario. It is essential to monitor these costs closely to ensure that it does not spiral out of control.

- <b>From the main page of Azure, you can navigate to the Cost Management pane. Again, if your account had proper privileges, you would be able to view different breakdowns of costs accrued by using different resources in the Azure portal.</b> 

- <b>For a further breakdown, you can navigate to the Cost Analysis pane. This provides different breakdowns of accrued costs in many different ways - including views for Totals, by resource, Daily costs etc.

- <b>Aside from reporting responsibilities, this is a fantastic tool to mitigate investment on return, as is a common concern for businesses moving from an in-house environment to a Cloud solution.</b>
